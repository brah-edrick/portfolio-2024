                  I was initially hired to architect a{" "}

                  for Redox‚Äôs core web experience, a{" "}

                  . I led this effort while simultaneously normalizing code and
                  design patterns and establishing front end best practices.
                  From there I became the foremost expert on front end
                  architecture at Redox and continued to deliver new features
                  and collaborate closely with our newly minted design team.

                <Paragraph>
                  Another major project I headed at Redox was the launch of our{" "}

                  , which is paramount to delivering key information to
                  customers on how to self serve and troubleshoot as well as
                  detailed examples of how to best use the Redox API.This
                  project was architected using{" "}

                    React, Gatsby, Typescript and a headless CMS, Contentful
                  </Bold>
                  . This set of technologies was essential to allowing our
                  content team to easily add, remove and reorder content, pages
                  and navigation while keeping the presentation separated from
                  the content. Delivering a custom implementation meant that the
                  dedicated team could avoid the limitations of a third party
                  solution. (Please note that this site is not optimized for

                  <Bold>Brad Frost‚Äôs atomic design</Bold>. I saw the power of
                  how atomic design could be used to have common language
                  between designers and developers as well as how it changes the

                  As I progressed in my career, and as web technology marched

                <Paragraph>
                  This is a project I worked on at <Bold>Redox</Bold>. It&apos;s
                  a comprehensive documentation site for the Redox API usage,
                  contracts and general user documentation.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                  This project had some really interesting engineering
                  challenges as the dedicated documentation team wanted a way to
                  manage the content in one location and share in several
                  different contexts. In addition to this, they wanted to easily
                  add, remove and reorder content, pages and navigation all
                  while keeping the presentation separated from the content. We
                  also wanted to be able to deliver some UX that would be
                  statically rendered from API contract definitions that the
                  engineering team maintained but still allow these pages to be
                  reordered and supplemented with additional content from the
                  documentation team. Finally everything needed to be searchable
                  and easily navigable. Unfortunately, Docusaraus didn&apos;t
                  exist at the time (it also can&apos;t do everything we needed)
                  so we had to forge our own solution.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                  To address these challenges we decided to use{" "}
                  <Bold>React, Gatsby, Typescript</Bold> and a{" "}
                  <Bold>headless CMS, Contentful</Bold> to deliver the site.
                  This set of technologies was essential to allowing our content
                  team to easily add, remove and reorder content, pages and
                  navigation while keeping the presentation separated from the
                  content. Delivering a custom implementation meant that the
                  dedicated team could avoid the limitations of a third party
                  solution and the engineering team could deliver highly custom
                  UX that was tailored to the needs of the documentation team.
                  Search was implemented using a client side Flexsearch plugin
                  and custom indexing logic that allowed a page to be indexed by
                  it&apos;s title and content author controlled tags/keywords.
                  (Please note that this site is not optimized for mobile
                  devices and also this project has been out of my custody for
                  some time so the experience may have changed)

                  This website! I created my new portfolio website fresh for
                  2024 (and refreshed in 2025). I wanted to focus on building
                  something minimal but still pleasant to interact with.
                  Responsiveness and fluidity were top of mind for this project
                  since I believe in a mobile first approach and a great
                  experience on all devices.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                  I began by researching and making note of other websites I
                  liked and what I liked about them. I then began to sketch out
                  wireframes and later moving on to Figma to create a high
                  fidelity mockup. I then began to build the site using{" "}
                  <Bold>React, Typescript, NextJS and Tailwind CSS</Bold> and
                  deployed it on <Bold>Vercel</Bold>.

                    This was my first non-trivial project using Tailwind. It‚Äôs a

                  <li>
                    There are lots of fun scroll effects and triggers using

                    I used <pre className="inline">mix-blend-mode</pre> to
                    achieve the dark and light mode effect.
