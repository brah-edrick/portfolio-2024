                    I was initially hired to architect a{" "}

                    and design patterns and establishing front-end best
                    practices. From there I became the foremost expert on
                    front-end architecture at Redox and continued to deliver new
                    features and collaborate closely with our newly formed

                    customers on how to self-serve and troubleshoot as well as
                    detailed examples of how to best use the Redox API. This

                    . This set of technologies was essential to allowing our
                    content team to easily add, remove and reorder content,
                    pages and navigation while keeping the presentation
                    separated from the content. Delivering a custom
                    implementation meant that the dedicated team could avoid the
                    limitations of a third party solution. (Please note that

                    <Bold>Tremor</Bold> and modern web technologies. This
                    project provides four specialized calculators to help users
                    explore different aspects of financial planning and
                    retirement scenarios

                  <Paragraph>
                    From a design perspective, this project presented unique
                    challenges in balancing presenting <Bold>useful data</Bold>{" "}
                    with an experience that <Bold>would not overwhelm</Bold>{" "}
                    users. Financial calculations can be intimidating and
                    mundane, so I focused on creating an interface that was
                    pleasant, approachable. I used default values that were
                    relatable and showed how possible financial independence can
                    be through small contributions over a long period of time.

                    Interactive charts and forms provide{" "}

                    the impact of their inputs in real-time and subtle
                    debouncing ensures that the experience is{" "}
                    <Bold>smooth and reactive</Bold> without thrashing on user
                    inputs. The entire experience is designed to build
                    confidence in users who might be intimidated by financial
                    planning.

                    This is a project I worked on at <Bold>Redox</Bold>. It‚Äôs a
                    comprehensive documentation site for the Redox API usage,
                    contracts and general user documentation.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph>
                    This project had some really interesting engineering
                    challenges as the dedicated documentation team wanted a way
                    to manage the content in one location and share in several
                    different contexts. In addition to this, they wanted to
                    easily add, remove and reorder content, pages and navigation
                    all while keeping the presentation separated from the
                    content. We also wanted to be able to deliver some UX that
                    would be statically rendered from API contract definitions
                    that the engineering team maintained but still allow these
                    pages to be reordered and supplemented with additional
                    content from the documentation team. Finally everything
                    needed to be searchable and easily navigable. Unfortunately,
                    Docusaurus didn‚Äôt exist at the time (it also can‚Äôt do
                    everything we needed) so we had to forge our own solution.
                  </Paragraph>
                  <Paragraph>
                    To address these challenges we decided to use{" "}
                    <Bold>React, Gatsby, TypeScript</Bold> and a{" "}
                    <Bold>headless CMS, Contentful</Bold> to deliver the site.
                    This set of technologies was essential to allowing our
                    content team to easily add, remove and reorder content,
                    pages and navigation while keeping the presentation
                    separated from the content. Delivering a custom
                    implementation meant that the dedicated team could avoid the
                    limitations of a third party solution and the engineering
                    team could deliver highly custom UX that was tailored to the
                    needs of the documentation team. Search was implemented
                    using a client-side FlexSearch plugin and custom indexing
                    logic that allowed a page to be indexed by its title and
                    author-controlled tags/keywords. (Please note that this site
                    is not optimized for mobile devices and also this project
                    has been out of my custody for some time so the experience
                    may have changed)

                    This website! I created my new portfolio website fresh for
                    2024 (and refreshed in 2025). I wanted to focus on building
                    something minimal but still pleasant to interact with.
                    Responsiveness and fluidity were top of mind for this
                    project since I believe in a mobile-first approach and a
                    great experience on all devices.

                    The design process began with{" "}
                    <Bold>market research and competitive analysis</Bold> -
                    studying other portfolios I admired and identifying what
                    made them effective. I then moved to{" "}
                    <Bold>wireframing and user flow mapping</Bold>, thinking
                    through how visitors would navigate and consume information.
                    This engineering mindset of considering user journeys early
                    in the process informed every design decision.

                    In Figma, I created high-fidelity mockups that balanced{" "}

                    design emphasizes readability, clear information hierarchy,
                    and smooth interactions. I paid particular attention to{" "}
                    <Bold>micro-interactions and transitions</Bold> - the subtle
                    animations that make the experience feel polished and fun.
                    The dark/light mode implementation using{" "}
                    <code className="inline">mix-blend-mode</code> was an
                    elegant solution to a common UX consideration.
